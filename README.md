## Projects during my MSc in Statistics

The work that is presented here is from my projects during my studies in the MSc Statistics at the London School of Economics in the years 2020 - 2022.

The projects were part of the following modules, some in R and some in Python.

* **Projects in Python**
From the module "Managing and Visualizing Data"


From the module "Distributed Computing for Big Data"



* **Projects in R**
From the module "Social Network Analysis"


  * From the module "Quantitative Text Analysis":
Main project: Analysis of sarcasm
The project tries to identify the features that reveal a sarcastic comment, based on the bag-of-words approach. 
The corpus is comments from a commentary website that are labelled on sarcasm and is balanced. 
The methodology followed starts with descriptive statistics on the document variables and some linguistic features of the corpus in relation to sarcasm. 
Sentiment and morality dictionaries were applied to examine the relationship of sarcasm with them. Na√Øve Bayes and Lasso Regression Supervised Learning models 
were used to classify the documents and identify good predictors of sarcasm. Dissimilarity metrics were used to examine the effect of a different text structure 
to sarcasm between the original comment and its answer. Finally, structural topic models and Latent Dirichlet Allocation were used, 
to uncover possible themes on the comments and explore their relationship with sarcastic ones.
