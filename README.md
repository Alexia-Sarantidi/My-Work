# Projects in Python and R during my MSc in Statistics

The work that is presented here is from my projects during my studies in the MSc Statistics at the London School of Economics in the years 2020 - 2022.

Some projects are in R and some in Python.

## Projects in Python

* For the module **"Managing and Visualizing Data"**

  Main project: Analysis of US Car Accidents
  
  Libraries used: pandas, numpy, json, math, missingno, requests, bs4, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, calendar, datetime, wordcloud, os, folium, earthpy, geopandas, plotly, xgboost


* For the module **"Distributed Computing for Big Data"**




## Projects in R

* For the module **"Social Network Analysis"**:

  Main project: Analysis of student exchange networks

  Libraries used: igraph, intergraph, sna, pheatmap, formattable, RColorBrewer, maps

  The project analyzes networks representing student exchanges between universities in Europe, as part of the Erasmus programme.


* For the module **"Quantitative Text Analysis"**:

  Main project: Analysis of sarcasm
  
  Libraries used: quanteda, tidyverse, stm, zoo, topicmodels, glmnet
  
  
   The project identifies the features that reveal a sarcastic comment, based on the bag-of-words approach. 
   The corpus is comments from a commentary website that are labelled on sarcasm. The methodology followed starts with descriptive statistics on the document variables and some linguistic features of the corpus in relation to sarcasm. Sentiment and morality dictionaries were applied to examine the relationship of sarcasm with them. Na√Øve Bayes and Lasso Regression Supervised Learning models were used to classify the documents and identify good predictors of sarcasm. Dissimilarity metrics were used to examine the effect of a different text structure to sarcasm between the original comment and its answer. Finally, structural topic models and Latent Dirichlet Allocation were used, to uncover possible themes on the comments and explore their relationship with sarcastic ones.
